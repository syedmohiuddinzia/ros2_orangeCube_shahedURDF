# Using Shahed URDF in ROS2 for Orange Cube IMU Data
This guide explains how to use the Shahed URDF in ROS 2 to represent and visualize Orange Cube IMU data.

Note:
This project builds upon the foundational setup detailed in [ros2_orangeCube_integration](https://github.com/syedmohiuddinzia/ros2_orangeCube_integration), and [ros2_orangeCube_imuMadgwickFilter](https://github.com/syedmohiuddinzia/ros2_orangeCube_imuMadgwickFilter)
Please make sure to follow the integration steps in the first repository to get your Cube Orange connected with ROS 2 and MAVROS properly, and then complete the second repository to ensure your IMU data is filtered and oriented before using it in this project.
